Adding interactivity to Jupyter Notebooks and web apps is a way to bring life to class materials and research reports.
Interactivity invites users to explore parameters and change the outcome of a code making the user participant of the discovery rather than a passive receptor of fixed knowledge.

<p>
The tools presented in this workshop offer this interactivity. We have selected four applications, these applications have matured and can be used to create materials for classes, real-time dashboards, data explorers, model demos, and sophisticated workflow apps.
</p>

<p>
The first two packages create interactive widgets, either for web applications as well as Jupyter Notebooks.
<a href="https://shiny.posit.co/py/">Shiny for Python</a> give you the tools to create web applications directly from Python. <a href="https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Jupyter Widgets</a> is a package to add interactive widgets to Jupyter Notebooks.
</p>

<p>
The other two tools are for interactive visualization. <a href="https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/">PyVista</a> allows you to interact with spatial-data visualizations. <a href="https://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/">Pymunk</a> is a 2D physics library that can be used to simulate 2D rigid body physics. 
</p>

<p>
These four packages are just a small selection of a wider set of packages that can help you introduce interactivity to the classroom and help you with data exploration and visualization.
